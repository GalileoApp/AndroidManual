# Launching the Application {#launchingTheApplication}

## App Permissions {#appPermissions}

On Android version 6.0 and higher, you will need to grant some permissions during using the Guru Maps.

### User Location {#userLocation}

When launching the Guru Maps application on your device for the first time, you will see the welcome tour with a set of permissions requests.

_Where Am I?
Let the app know your location to show it on the map ans record GPS tracks._


Message asking if it is allowed to access Location Services data. This is a standard request for permission that is generated by all programs that use location services. Choose one of these options:

* Tapping **ALLOW** will give the app permission to use Location Services to determine your current location on a map if needed.
* Tapping **DENY** will prevent the app from accessing your location. You may allow location services access for the Guru Maps  at any time in system Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Guru Maps &gt; Permissions.

Location-based information within the app might be unavailable, inaccurate, or incomplete unless you turn on Location Services. Location Services uses GPS along with crowd-sourced Wi-Fi hotspots and cellular towers to determine the approximate location of your device.

* Tapping **OK** will continue your previous action.
* Tapping **NO, THANKS** will prevent the app from accessing your location. You may enable Location Services for Guru Maps at any time in system Settings &gt; Location.


Most Android devices have additional energy-saving systems that automatically stop apps that are running in the background when they need resources.
Make sure Guru Maps has access to your smartphone's GPS in the background and no battery optimization or saving mode is applied for the app.


### Read & Write Permissions {#readWritePermissions}

If you use the app feature, that requires permission to read/write on your device storage \(such as [Data Backup](03-settings.md#dataBackup)\), you will see a message asking you to enable it.

* Tapping **ALLOW** will continue your previous action.
* Tapping **DENY** will prevent the app from accessing your device storage. You may allow read/write permissions for Guru Maps at any time in system Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Guru Maps &gt; Permissions.

## Download a Map {#DownloadAMap}

When you allow the Guru Map to use your location, the app will ask you to download the map for your region when launching it for the first time.

Other regions will be available for download while browsing and zooming directly on the map or from the app settings at [Download Maps](02-features.md#download) menu.

## Navigating a Map {#navigatingTheMap}

There are standard and well-known gestures such as tap, drag and pinch which are used to interact with the app.  
To **move the map**, drag it with your finger in the direction you want to position the map:  

<img src="/assets/finger-moving.png" width="53" height="84" />  

To **zoom in**, use double tap or pinch your thumb and finger apart:  
 
<img src="/assets/double-tap.png" width="53" height="84" /> <img src="/assets/expanding.png" width="75" height="83" />  

To **zoom out**, tap with two fingers or pinch your thumb and finger together:  
 
<img src="/assets/two-finger-tap.png" width="58" height="84" /> <img src="/assets/reducing-size.png" width="71" height="84" />

To **zoom in/out with only one finger**, double-tap the map, hold the second tap and drag your finger up or down.

To **zoom using on-map +/- buttons**, go to the app setting [Show Zoom Buttons](/03-settings.md#appearance) to enable them. 

To **rotate the map**, hold the map with two fingers and drag them simultaneously in a circular motion. A compass icon will appear which you can tap to return the map to north-up:

Tap the map and hold to bring up the pop-up with available options \(from left to right\):  

1. Bookmark this location  
2. Mark your current location  
3. Get route directions to this location

To measure the straight line distance between two points “as the crow flies”, tap your starting and destination points simultaneously with your fingers on the map and hold to trace the path. A dashed line will appear on the map between the two locations, and the estimated distance will then be displayed:

## Interface Overview {#interfaceOverview}

### Application Modes {#applicationModes}

#### Location button {#locationButton}

The app works in multiple modes depending on a number of taps on _Location_ button with the following sign ![](/assets/icon_gps.png). Your position is shown on the map as a blue marker when you are staying and as a blue arrow when you are moving:

<img src="/assets/map_location.png" width="250" height="250" /> <img src="/assets/map_driving.png" width="250" height="250" />

**Tip:** if your location cannot be determined precisely, a blue circle also appears around the location marker. The size of the circle depends on how accurately your location can be determined: the smaller the circle – the greater the accuracy.

#### Tracking mode {#trackingMode}

To determine your current approximate location on the map and enable the **tracking mode**, tap once the _Location_ button:

![](/assets/icon_gps.png) → ![](/assets/icon_gps_act.png)

Once tracking mode is active, the map is oriented to the north and the app tracks your position on a map as you move. To exit the tracking mode, move the map.

#### Driving mode {#drivingMode}

To enable the **driving mode**, double tap the _Location_ button:

![](/assets/icon_gps.png) → ![](/assets/icon_gps_act.png) → ![](/assets/icon_compas.png)

While in driving mode, the map is oriented in the direction you are currently moving.

#### Compass mode 

To enable the **compass mode**,  tap three times the _Location_ button:

![](/assets/icon_gps.png) → ![](/assets/icon_gps_act.png) → ![](/assets/icon_compas.png) → ![](/assets/icon_compas_con.png)

While in compas mode, the map is oriented by compass and rotates as you rotate your device and reflects your actual environment.

**Note**: the accuracy of the compass can be affected by magnetic or environmental interference. 

#### Location services {#locationServices}

Every time you see this icon ![](/assets/icon_question.png), it means that your GPS currently cannot get information about your location. It may also appear when Location Services is disabled on your device.

**Note:** depending on your device and available services, Location Services uses a combination of cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to determine your location. If you're not within a clear line of sight to GPS satellites, your device can determine your location using crowd-sourced Wi-Fi and cell tower locations.

## Trip Computer {#tripComputer}

The trip computer panel provides you all the necessary trip statistics while moving. If enabled, it will display such useful information as \(from left to right\):

<img src="/assets/trip_monitor_1.png" width="375" height="56" />

* current speed
* altitude

While recording a GPS track it will additionally display \(from left to right\):

<img src="/assets/trip_monitor_2.png" width="375" height="114" />

* distance traveled
* trip duration

To hide the trip computer panel from map view, go to app Settings &gt; Show Trip Computer.

# Navigating the Map

There are standard and well known gestures such as tap, drag and pinch which are used to interact with the app.  
To **move the map**, drag it with your finger in the direction you want to position the map:

To **zoom in**, use double tap or pinch your thumb and finger apart:

To **zoom out**, tap with two fingers or pinch your thumb and finger together:

Tip: to zoom in/out with only one finger, double-tap the map, hold the second tap and drag your finger up or down.  
To **zoom using on-map +/- buttons**, go to app [Settings &gt; Show Zoom Buttons]() to enable them.

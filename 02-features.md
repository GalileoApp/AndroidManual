* To **remove a map** swipe your finger across the country name from right to left, then tap the Delete button, or use the **Edit** button.

As OpenStreetMap data is constantly updated by thousands of volunteers around the world, map updates are available from time to time within the app. In Guru Maps app all vector map updates are free and distributed automatically. If there is an update for a downloaded map, you will see **Update** button near the downloaded map name:

<img src="/assets/update_downloaded_map.png" width="375" height="93" />

To **update all your downloaded maps** tap the **“Update All”** button in toolbar menu:

<img src="/assets/update_all_button.png" width="375" height="139" />

## Search {#search}

The app lets you search within [My Collections](02-features.md#collections) content as well as map OpenStreetMap.org data.  
To open the search screen, tap the ![](/assets/icon_serach.png) search button. Type or paste the word you want to find in the search field.  
Search results will be displayed on the map and in the list below the search field. It is also possible to narrow down your search using the **“Search around me”** option at the bottom.  

Tap an any of the results in the list to open its entry or back to the map to overview them all. The search will be refined as you browse the map automatically and only results meeting the selected search criteria will be displayed in the visible area.
If search results are found, the search icon will be changed to the ![](/assets/icon_search_results.png).
To reset search results, tap the clear ![](/assets/icon_cross.png) icon.  

**Note:** if you didn't clean your search query - search results will be displayed on a map as icons:

<img src="/assets/search_query_1.png" width="375" height="397" /> 

<img src="/assets/search_query_2.png" width="375" height="351" />

**Voice Search**: You can use your voice to perform a search instead of typing when you're connected to the Internet. Just tap the search field, and then tap the microphone icon to start dictating. When you’re finished, wait for your words to be processed. It can take a few seconds for text to appear.

The search screen is separated into three parts: 
 
* Categories  
* Search history  
* Nearest bookmarks

**Note**: The App makes searching within the downloaded offline maps and only places which are mapped within OpenStreetMap can be found and displayed.

Performing a search in the following ways allows you to search places fast and easy:

* by categories,  
* by name,
* by GPS coordinates,
* by address (**internet connection required**).


### Search by category

There are predefined categories available on the screen for a quick search. Just tap the category icon \(food, accommodation, etc\) to list the matching results for a given category:

<img src="/assets/search_2.png" width="375" height="440" />

You can also narrow your search by entering keyword after the category name as shown below:

<img src="/assets/search_3.png" width="375" height="442" />

### Search by name

Just start typing the name of the object you are looking for. As you type, you'll see a list of search results and suggestions:

<img src="/assets/search_4.png" width="375" height="401" />

**Tip**: It is not necessary to type punctuation or worry about capital letters, but the search will not recognize a misspelling.

### Coordinates search

If you know the exact coordinates of a location, you can simply enter them into the search field to locate it on the map:

<img src="/assets/search_5.png" width="375" height="193" />

**Tip**: You may enter the coordinates in any of the supported coordinate formats. To avoid confusion while inputting coordinates from the keyboard it is possible to use spaces instead of \(‘\) Right Single Quotation Mark, \(”\) Right Double Quotation Mark or \(°\) Degree Sign.

### Address search

Type city, zip or address of any location on the world map \(in that sequence with a comma as shown\). If there are no search results found within the downloaded maps, tap **Search** to perform a search **online**:

<img src="/assets/search_address_1.png" width="375" height="339" />

To get routed to the selected search result, swipe right on the cell in the list:

<img src="/assets/search_address_2.png" width="375" height="352" />

To view more address and contact information, tap the desired result in the list.

<img src="/assets/search_address_3.png" width="375" height="540" />

To save search result to your collections, tap ![](/assets/icon_save_to_collections.png) icon at the bottom of details screen.


## Navigation {#navigation}

Guru Maps gives you the ability to find the best route and get step by step directions for your drive or walk.

<img src="/assets/track_ercording_notification.png" width="375" height="414" />

**Note**: to record GPS tracks in background, make sure you have disabled Battery Saver in device settings.

#### View GPS track details {#TrackDetails}

<img src="/assets/track_description.png" width="375" height="667" />

To **view track details** tap the ![](/assets/icon_info.png) icon next to the track name on the map or open it from the My Collections list.

To **edit track name and description** tap the name or description field and use the onscreen keyboard to type a new text.

To **move a track to another collection** tap the field with the collection name and select the new name from the list of available collections, then tap Back.

To **change track style** tap the desired color or set the track color based on speed or altitude.

To **view track on the map** tap ![](/assets/icon_show_on_map.png) icon to open the map centered on the selected GPS track.

To **hide a track from the map** scroll down the track details screen and tap ![](/assets/icon_hide.png) icon. To reveal it tap ![](/assets/icon_show.png) icon.

To **export a track** tap the ![](/assets/icon_share.png) icon at the bottom of the track details screen and choose the way to save your data.

To **delete a track** tap the ![](/assets/icon_trash.png) icon at the bottom of the track details screen.

<img src="/assets/track_gradient.png" width="375" height="667" />

**Note:** filters settings influence the appearance of track on a map and size of track while exporting, but they **do not** affect the number of recorded points.

#### Accuracy Threshold 

Filter by the minimum accuracy of the received points. Points that are on the outside of the filter value will not be displayed in the track.

**Example**: You are recording your GPS track while walking around your neighborhood and you have entered a supermarket. Tall walls, roofs and other obstructions can block the signal from GPS satellites and the device cannot determine your location accurately enough. You may enable the accuracy filter to hide GPS points if they are too far from your location. If the received signal has lower than the required accuracy, that points will not be displayed in the track.

#### Distance Threshold 

Filter by the minimum distance between points of a recorded track. Points that are closer than the distance specified in the filter will not be displayed in the track.

**Example**: You are recording your GPS track while jogging, then you meet a friend and stop to talk to him. As the GPS sends location coordinates every second, too many points will be recorded on the same spot while you are talking and too many lines of a track will be drawn. You may enable the distance filter to hide GPS points if they are too close to each other and get rid of unnecessary lines.

**Note:** you can change gradient to show speed or altitude during the route by tapping button in the upper right corner. The point on the track is related to the speed and altitude values.

# Features

In this article we will show some distinguishing features, that will make your Galileo experience easier and more complete.

## Search {#search}

The app lets you search within [My Collections](02-features.md#collections) content as well as map OpenStreetMap.org data.  
To open the search screen, tap the ![](/assets/icon_serach.png) search button. Type or paste the word you want to find in the search field.  
Search results will be displayed on the map and in the list below the search field. It is also possible to narrow down your search using the **“Search around me”** option at the bottom.  

Tap an any of the results in the list to open its entry or back to the map to overview them all. The search will be refined as you browse the map automatically and only results meeting the selected search criteria will be displayed in the visible area.
If search results are found, the search icon will be changed to the ![](/assets/icon_search_results.png). To reset search results, tap the clear ![](/assets/icon_cross.png) icon.  

**Note:** if you didn't clean your search query - search results will be displayed on a map as icons:

<img src="/assets/search_query_1.png" width="375" height="667" />
 
<img src="/assets/search_query_2.png" width="375" height="667" />

**Voice Search**: You can use your voice to perform a search instead of typing when you're connected to the Internet. Just tap the search field, and then tap the microphone icon to start dictating. When you’re finished, wait for your words to be processed. It can take a few seconds for text to appear.

The search screen is separated into three parts: 
 
* Categories  
* Search history  
* Nearest bookmarks

**Note**: offline search is possible within the downloaded offline maps and only places which are mapped at OpenStreetMap.org could be found.


### Search by category

There are predefined categories available on the screen for a quick search. Just tap the category icon \(food, accommodation, etc\) to list the matching results for a given category:

<img src="/assets/search_2.png" width="375" height="440" />

You can also narrow your search by entering keyword after the category name as shown below:

<img src="/assets/search_3.png" width="375" height="442" />

### Search by name

Just start typing the name of the object you are looking for. As you type, you'll see a list of search results and suggestions:

Tip: It is not necessary to type punctuation or worry about capital letters, but the search will not recognize a misspelling:

### Coordinates search

If you know the exact coordinates of a location, you can simply enter them into the search field to locate it on the map:

<img src="/assets/search_5.png" width="375" height="193" />

**Tip**: You may enter the coordinates in any of the supported coordinate formats. Read also: [Units Format](03-settings.md#unitsFormat).

### Address search

<img src="/assets/route_to_bookmark.png" width="375" /> 

A map will appear with your driving route highlighted in blue with some route information at the bottom: distance to go, time to go, arrival time:

<img src="/assets/route_set.png" width="375" /> 

Route will be shown for **drive** mode by default, but you may choose the appropriate mode for your needs (driving, cycling, walking, in a straight line):

<img src="/assets/route_set_2.png" width="375" />

If you choose cycle or pedestrian mode, a gradient will appear which shows an altitude during the route (**gradient will appear only if there is an internet connection**):

<img src="/assets/navigation_2.png" width="375" />

**Note:** the point on the track is related to the speed and altitude values.


The see an overview of your driving route, scroll down to the turn-by-turn driving directions:

<img src="/assets/driving_directions.png" width="375"/>


#### Add waypoints

Waypoints are via locations, that you want to go through along your route before you reach your destination. There are two ways to add waypoints to a route:

* by tapping and holding on a location directly on the map:
<img src="/assets/waypoint_add_map.png" width="375"/>
* by tapping "+ Add Waypoint" from the list and searching for the waypoint:
<img src="/assets/waypoint_add_list.png" width="375"/>


The route will be adjusted automatically after adding any waypoint. Once the route is calculated, you can drag and drop the waypoints on the map or reorder directly from the list to recalculate the route dynamically.

To remove the waypoint, tap it on the map:  
<img src="/assets/waypoint_remove_map.png" width="375"/>



The service error message "Path distance exceeds the max distance limit" will appear when the route is greater than the service limits:

## GPS Tracks {#GPSTracks}

Guru Maps lets you record your movements, view detailed statistics and export recorded GPS tracks in most common formats.

#### Record GPS Track

To **record GPS Track**, tap the **REC** button on the map. It will become red. If you recorded track before, you will be prompted to continue the last track recording, or to start a new one. Tap the **REC** button again and the recording stops.

<img src="/assets/track_ercording_notification.png" width="375" />

**Note**: to record GPS tracks in background, make sure you have disabled Battery Saver in device settings.

#### View GPS track details {#TrackDetails}

<img src="/assets/track_description.png" width="375" />

To **view track details** tap the track line on the map, then drag the bottom drawer upward to its full height or open it from the My Collections list.

To **edit track name and description** tap the name or description field and use the onscreen keyboard to type a new text.

To **move a track to another collection** tap the field with the collection name and select the new name from the list of available collections, then tap Back.

To **change track style** tap the desired color or set the track color based on speed or altitude.

To **view track on the map** tap ![](/assets/icon_show_on_map.png) icon to open the map centered on the selected GPS track.

To **hide a track from the map** scroll down the track details screen and tap ![](/assets/icon_hide.png) icon. To reveal it tap ![](/assets/icon_show.png) icon.

To **export a track** tap the ![](/assets/icon_share.png) icon at the bottom of the track details screen and choose the way to save your data.

To **delete a track** tap the ![](/assets/icon_trash.png) icon at the bottom of the track details screen.

To **filter GPS data** and delete inaccurate points in the already recorded track, tap _GPS Filtering_:

<img src="/assets/track_gradient.png" width="375"/>

**Note:** filters settings influence the appearance of track on a map and size of track while exporting, but they **do not** affect the number of recorded points.

#### Accuracy Threshold 

Filter by the minimum accuracy of the received points. Points that are on the outside of the filter value will not be displayed in the track.

**Example**: You are recording your GPS track while walking around your neighborhood and you have entered a supermarket. Tall walls, roofs and other obstructions can block the signal from GPS satellites and the device cannot determine your location accurately enough. You may enable the accuracy filter to hide GPS points if they are too far from your location. If the received signal has lower than the required accuracy, that points will not be displayed in the track.

#### Distance Threshold 

Filter by the minimum distance between points of a recorded track. Points that are closer than the distance specified in the filter will not be displayed in the track.

**Example**: You are recording your GPS track while jogging, then you meet a friend and stop to talk to him. As the GPS sends location coordinates every second, too many points will be recorded on the same spot while you are talking and too many lines of a track will be drawn. You may enable the distance filter to hide GPS points if they are too close to each other and get rid of unnecessary lines.

**Note:** you can change gradient to show speed or altitude during the route by tapping button in the upper right corner. The point on the track is related to the speed and altitude values.

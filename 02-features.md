## Importing KML/KMZ/GPX Files {#importing}

You can easily import KML/KMZ/GPX files into the Galileo Offline Maps app in several ways: from file manager, email, weblink or Dropbox.  
Note: the following tags are not currently supported for imported KML files: &ltMultiGeometry&gt; and &ltPolygon&gt;.

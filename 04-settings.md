# Settings

> Guru Maps is available in a ready-to-use state and app settings should be considered as an optional and more advanced way of using the app. Settings let you configure app options, purchase additional features and manage geo data representation.

## Vector Maps Settings {#vectorMapsSettings}

### Font and Languages {#fontsAndLanguages}

#### Font size 

You can configure Guru Maps to display all text on a vector map at a comfortable font size. To increase, decrease, or change the default font size, go to app Settings > Font and Languages.

#### Preferred language order

In some regions, objects on the map in addition to local names have names in other languages. A map will show the names on the first language in this list if exists. It may be useful for multilingual countries, such as Belgium where Dutch, French and German share official language status:

#### Voice instructions {#voiceSettings}

The default language for voice instructions you hear while navigating a route depends on the language your device is set to use.  
To change the language, select one from the Voice Instructions list:

**Note**: as the App uses text-to-speech \(TTS\) engine instead of pre-recorded audio, correct pronunciation depends on the TTS engine.

#### Auto-record track during navigation

## Synchronization {#sync}

To enable synchronization feature, go to the app Settings > Sync and select the appropriate way to authenticate.

## Data Backup {#dataBackup}

Backing up data is a great way to minimize accidental data loss and restore the most important geodata on your device.

#### Create backup

#### Save backup

Backups are stored on your device and will be removed automatically when the app is removed. To prevent data loss, we recommend saving your backups regularly.

You can use cloud services (Dropbox, OneDrive, Adobe Creative Cloud, Google Drive, etc) to save them.

* Move .gbackup2 file to Internal Storage &gt; Guru\_backups folder. All .gbackup2 files from this directory will be listed in Guru Maps. Go to Settings &gt; Data Backup and tap preferred backup.

**Note**: restoring from backup will remove all current bookmarks and GPS tracks in My Collections.


## Maps Storage {#mapsStorage}

If your device supporting SD Card memory extension and one of your storages become insufficient you can change default Map Download Storage in Settings &gt; Maps Storage.

If you don’t see Maps Storage Settings your device might not support SD Card memory extension or SD Card is not present.

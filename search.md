To open the search screen, tap the ![](/assets/icon_serach.png) search button. Type or paste the word you want to find in the search field.  
Search results will be displayed on the map and in the list. Results are limited and no more than 100 records will be returned per search.  
Tap an any of the results in the list to open its entry. To reset search results, tap the clear icon ![](/assets/icon_cross.png).  
If there are search results, the search icon will be changed to the ![](/assets/icon_search_results.png).

### Offline Search {#offlineSearch}

Performing an offline search in the following ways allows you to search places quick and easy:

* by category,
* by name,
* by GPS coordinates.
  Note: The app makes searching within the [downloaded offline maps]() by default. If there are no results, you will be prompted to switch to online search mode.

Search screen is separated in three parts:  
1. Categories  
2. Search history  
3. Nearest bookmarks

**Search by category**. There are predefined categories available on the screen for a quick search. Just tap the category icon \(food, accommodation, etc\) to list the matching results for a given category.

You can also narrow your search by entering keyword after the category name as shown below:

![](/assets/search_3.png)

**Search by name**. Just start typing the name of the object you are looking for. As you type, you'll see a list of search results and suggestions.

![](/assets/search_4.png)

Tip: It is not necessary to type punctuation or worry about capital letters, but the search will not recognize a misspelling.  
**Coordinates search**. If you know the exact coordinates of a location, you can simply enter them into the search field to locate it on the map.

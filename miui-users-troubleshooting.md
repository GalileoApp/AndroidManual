## MIUI users troubleshooting ##

**Xiaomi and other MIUI phones issue**. MIUI by default doesn’t let apps in the background access GPS, which is what causes this issue.

Here’s what you need to do to solve the problem:

* Pull down toggle bar.
* Hold the GPS icon to reach GPS settings.
* Here, change Location mode to High accuracy

To make sure the app isn’t killed while in background go to Settings  > Battery & performance > Manage app battery usage, now disable/turn off Power saving mode or add Galileo to battery saver exceptions, by clicking Choose apps > Galileo > No restrictions.

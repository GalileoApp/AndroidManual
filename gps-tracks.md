## GPS Tracks

Galileo Offline Maps lets you record your movements, view detailed statistics and export recorded GPS tracks in most common formats.

**Record GPS Track**. Tap the REC button on the screen with the map. It changes dot color from gray to red. If you recorded track before, you will be suggested to continue last track recording, or start the new one. Tap the REC button again and the recording stops:

* ![](/assets/icon_rec_disabled.png) — track is not recording,
* ![](/assets/icon_rec_enabled.png) — track is recording now.

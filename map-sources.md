## Map Sources

To switch to another map to display, select Map Source menu in app settings. There are 4 types of maps you can use within the app:

* Offline vector map,
* Online raster maps,
* Offline raster maps,
* Imported map sources.

### Offline vector map {#offlineVectorMap}

Vector map source is set by default. It uses data from OpenStreetMap. App visualise this data and display a map in readily comprehensible form.

Note: vector and raster are the two basic data structures for storing maps. Vector map is a set of map features expressed by different types of geometry: points, lines and polygons. While raster map is represented by square images, therefore vector maps are smaller than raster maps. Plus, vector map works faster and it is simpler to update and maintain, whereas a raster image will have to be completely reproduced \(e.g. when a new road is added\).

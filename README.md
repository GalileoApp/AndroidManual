### What is Galileo Offline Maps?

Galileo Offline Maps is a complex solution for travelers, which allows you to navigate and [search](Link URL) around the world offline. Also you can create bookmarks and record tracks, which will be stored to [Collections](Link URL). You will never loose your collections considering [backup](Link URL) and [synchronization](Link URL) features. Navigation will provide you with complete road instructions and [voice guidance](#markdown-header-voice-guidance).

### About This Manual

This user manual is designed to help you get started as quickly as possible by introducing you to Galileo Offline Maps’ main features. For a quick start guide, please refer to the introduction tour, which is available within the app from the Help menu.  
Feel free to ask for further assistance or to report any problems you find at info@galileo-app.com or choose Contact Support option directly within the app settings.

## App permissions

On Android version 6.0 and higher you will need to grant some permissions during using Galileo.

### User location

When launching the Galileo application on your device for the first time, you will see a message asking for Galileo to access Location Services data. This is a standard request for permission that is generated by all programs that use location services.

* Tapping ALLOW will give the app permission to use Location Services to determine your current location on map if needed.
* Tapping DENY will prevent the app from accessing your location. You may allow location services access for Galileo at any time in system Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Galileo &gt; Permissions.

![](/assets/location_permissions.png)

If you use Galileo feature, that require location services \(Such as [Tracking](Link URL) and [Routing](Link URL)\), you will see message asking you to enable it, if was disabled before.

* Tapping OK will continue your previous action.
* Tapping CANCEL will prevent the app from accessing your location. You may enable Location Services for Galileo at any time in system Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location Services. \(Settings  &gt; Location Services\).

![](/assets/enable_gps.png)

If you use Galileo feature, that require permission to read/write on your device storage \(Such as [Data backup](Link URL)\), you will see message asking you to enable it.

* Tapping ALLOW will continue your previous action.
* Tapping DENY will prevent the app from accessing your device storage. You may allow read/write permissions for Galileo at any time in system Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Galileo &gt; Permissions. 

![](/assets/read_write_permission.png)

## Navigating the Map

There are standard and well known gestures such as tap, drag and pinch which are used to interact with the app.  
To **move the map**, drag it with your finger in the direction you want to position the map:  
![](/assets/finger-moving.png)  
To **zoom in**, use double tap or pinch your thumb and finger apart:  
![](/assets/double-tap.png) ![](/assets/expanding.png)  
To **zoom out**, tap with two fingers or pinch your thumb and finger together:  
![](/assets/two-finger-tap.png) ![](/assets/reducing-size.png)  
Tip: to zoom in/out with only one finger, double-tap the map, hold the second tap and drag your finger up or down.  
To **zoom using on-map +/- buttons**, go to app [Settings &gt; Show Zoom Buttons]() to enable them.

# Interface Overview

* [Application Modes]()
* [Trip Monitor]()
* [Map Sources]()

## Application Modes

### Location button

The app works in multiple modes depending on number of taps on _Location_ button with the following sign ![](/assets/icon_gps.png). Your position is shown on the map as a blue marker when you are staying and as a blue arrow when you are moving:

![](/assets/map_location.png) ![](/assets/map_driving.png)

Tip: if your location cannot be determined precisely, a blue circle also appears around the location marker. The size of the circle depends on how accurately your location can be determined: the smaller the circle – the greater the accuracy.

### Tracking mode

To determine your current approximate location on the map and enable the **tracking mode**, tap once the _Location_ button:

![](/assets/icon_gps.png) → ![](/assets/icon_gps_act.png)

Once tracking mode is active, app tracks your position on map as you move. To exit the tracking mode, move the map.

### Driving mode

To enable the **driving mode**, double tap the _Location_ button:

![](/assets/icon_gps.png) → ![](/assets/icon_gps_act.png) → ![](/assets/icon_compas.png)

While in driving mode, the app will orient the map in the direction you are currently moving. If you stop moving, the map will be oriented by compass.

Note: the accuracy of the compass can be affected by magnetic or environmental interference \(e.g. the magnets in earbuds\) and compass may need to be calibrated from time to time. When the device displays the calibration alert, tilt the screen to move the red ball around in a circle.

### Location services

Every time you see this icon ![](/assets/icon_question.png), it means that your GPS cannot currently get information about your location. It may also appear when Location Services is disabled on your device.

Note: depending on your device and available services, Location Services uses a combination of cellular, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS to determine your location. If you're not within a clear line of sight to GPS satellites, your device can determine your location using crowd-sourced Wi-Fi and cell tower locations.

## Trip Monitor

Trip monitor panel provides you all the necessary trip statistics while moving. If enabled, it will display such useful information as \(from left to right\):

![](/assets/trip_monitor_1.png)

* current speed
* altitude

While recording a GPS track it will additionally display \(from left to right\):

![](/assets/trip_monitor_2.png)

* distance traveled
* trip duration

To hide trip monitor panel from map view, go to app [Settings &gt; Show Trip Monitor]().

## Map Sources

To switch to another map to display, select Map Source menu in app settings. There are 4 types of maps you can use within the app:

* Offline vector map,
* Online raster maps,
* Offline raster maps,
* Imported map sources.

### Offline vector map

Vector map source is set by default. It uses data from OpenStreetMap. App visualise this data and display a map in readily comprehensible form.

Note: vector and raster are the two basic data structures for storing maps. Vector map is a set of map features expressed by different types of geometry: points, lines and polygons. While raster map is represented by square images, therefore vector maps are smaller than raster maps. Plus, vector map works faster and it is simpler to update and maintain, whereas a raster image will have to be completely reproduced \(e.g. when a new road is added\).

### Default Styles

To set a color for GPS tracks and category for bookmarks used by default, go to app Settings &gt; Default Styles.  
**Default track style**. Selected style is a default line style for the newly recorded and imported GPS tracks:

_1. By color:_

![](/assets/default_styles_1.png)

_2. By speed:_

![](/assets/default_styles_2.png)

_3. By altitude:_

![](/assets/default_styles_3.png)

**Default bookmark category**. Selected category is a default icon for newly created and imported bookmarks.

![](/assets/default_styles.png)

## Advanced

### Sync

Galileo allows you to sync your collections between all your devices \(Android and iOS\). The only thing you need to do, is login using your Facebook or Google account. Go to Settings &gt; Sync and choose one of these.

![](/assets/sync.png)

Consider to use same account on all devices which you want to sync Collections.

### Navigation

You can change language of navigation voice instructions, by choosing it in Settings &gt; Navigation &gt; Voice Instructions.

![](/assets/settings_navigation_language.png)

If preferable language is not supported by your default Text-To-Speech Engine \(TTS\) it will appear in light gray colour. In this case try to choose another TTS in System Settings &gt; Language & Input &gt;  Speech &gt; Text-to-speech output, or install the new one, which support your preferable language.

### Data Backup

Backing up data is a great way to minimize accidental data loss and restore the most important geodata on your device.  
**Create backup**. Tap Back Up My Collections button on Settings &gt; Data Backup screen to backup the collections within the app.  
Note: created backup only includes data from My Collections \(bookmarks and GPS tracks\), and it doesn't include downloaded and cached tiles.  
When the backup finished successfully, you'll see the name of the device along with the date and time the backup was created:

![](/assets/backup.png)

Save backup. Backups are stored on your device and will be removed automatically when the app is removed. To prevent data loss, we recommend to save your backups regularly.

* To save the backup on your computer, launch iTunes and copy it using the File Sharing option.
* To share backup via another application, tap the ![](/assets/icon_share.png) icon.

![](/assets/backup_share.png)

Restore from a backup. There are several ways to restore your data from backup:

* Select .gbackup file from any file manager installed and choose Galileo:

![](/assets/open_backup_file_manager.png)

* Select item from your cloud service \(e.g. in Dropbox app\) and choose Galileo:

![](/assets/open_backup_dropbox.png)

* Move .gbackup file to Internal Storage &gt; Galileo\_backups folder. All .gbackup files from this directory will be listed in Galileo. Go to Settings &gt; Data Backup and tap prefered backup.

Important: restoring from backup will remove all current bookmarks and GPS tracks in My Collections.

### Cache info

To switch between the map sources and select the map which is the best one for you, go to [Settings &gt; Map Source]().  
Map Refresh. To set how often to refresh cached map tiles, go to Settings &gt; Cache Info. All tiles older than selected time will be downloaded while browsing online.

![](/assets/cache_info.png)

**Cache Info**. All loaded map tiles will be automatically saved to your device's storage and can be managed in Settings &gt; Cache Info, so you can delete the tiles you no longer need if you want to free up storage space.

Read also: [Custom Map Sources]().

### Maps Storage

If your device supporting SD Card memory extension and one of your storages become insufficient you can change default Map Download Storage in Settings &gt; Maps Storage. After selection one of the available storages all downloaded Maps will be moved to selected one. Maps will be downloaded on the storage with the largest amount of free space by default. If you don’t see Maps Storage Settings your device might not support SD Card memory extension or SD Card is not present.

![](/assets/maps_storage.png)

### GPS Filtering

Galileo Offline Maps app supports GPS data filtering in Settings &gt; GPS Filtering.  
**Accuracy Threshold**. Filter by the minimum accuracy at which the new points will be accepted. New points will be added to GPS track while recording if the accuracy is lower than selected \(recommended value is 150 m\).

![](/assets/accuracy_threshold.png)

Example: You are recording your GPS track while walking around your neighbourhood and you have entered a supermarket. Tall walls, roofs and other obstructions can block the signal from GPS satellites and the device cannot determine your location accurately enough. You may enable the accuracy filter to set the required accuracy and ignore inaccurate GPS data. If the received signal has lower than the required accuracy, that point will not be recorded in the track.  
**Distance Threshold**. Filter by the minimum distance travelled before a new point will be recorded. New points will be added to GPS track while recording if the distance between them is greater than selected \(recommended value is 5 m\).

![](/assets/distance_threshold.png)

Example: You are recording your GPS track while jogging, then you meet a friend and stop to talk to him. As the GPS sends location coordinates every second, too many points will be recorded on the same spot while you are talking, and the recorded track will take up more space. You may enable the distance filter to ignore GPS points if they are too close to each other. New points will start recording as you exceed the distance selected in the filter.

### Units Format

To set the units system and coordinates format you would like to use within the Galileo Offline Maps, go to Settings &gt; Units Format.  
**Units system**. The following units of measure for distance and speed are available to select from:

* **km** — for kilometres & km/h,
* **mi** — for miles & mph,
* **NM** — for nautical miles & kts.

**Coordinates format**. In Galileo Offline Maps you can choose to represent your coordinates in any way you like. The coordinate format you select will be used to display all coordinates within the app. Here is an example of different coordinate formats for New York city follows:

* +40.730598, -73.986580 \(DDD.DDDDD\)
* 40°43'50.1" N, 73°59'11.6" W \(DDD°MM' SS.S"\)
* 40°43.835' N, 73°59.194' W \(DDD°MM.MMM’\)
* 40.73060° N, 73.98658° W \(DDD.DDDDD°\)
* 18TWL 85577 09345 \(MGRS\)

# Tips and Tricks and Troubleshooting

In this section, we will go over some of advanced features as they pertain to specific areas of the using the app:

* [Custom Map Sources]()
* [Offline Maps Import]()
* [Getting Exported Files]()

## Custom Map Sources

In addition to built-in online raster maps, Galileo Offline Maps also supports custom online maps. You can add any map source you like using a special XML file that contains description of map provider.

**Simple custom map sources**. The following example shows how the XML file for OpenStreetMap source may be defined:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<customMapSource>
<name>OpenStreetMap</name>
<url>http://{$serverpart}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{$z}/{$x}/{$y}.png</url>
<serverParts>a b c</serverParts>
</customMapSource>
```

**Custom multi-layer map sources**. Map sources which consist of two or more layers can be defined, similar to single-layer custom map sources. The following example shows how the XML file for OpenSeaMap hybrid source may be defined:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<customMapSource>
<name>OpenSeaMap</name>
<minZoom>0</minZoom>
<maxZoom>18</maxZoom>
<layers>
<layer>
<url>http://{$serverpart}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{$z}/{$x}/{$y}.png</url>
<serverParts>a b c</serverParts>
</layer>
<layer>
<minZoom>9</minZoom>
<maxZoom>18</maxZoom>
<url>http://tiles.openseamap.org/seamark/{$z}/{$x}/{$y}.png</url>
</layer>
</layers>
</customMapSource>
```

The most important tags of this definition are described below:

&lt;name&gt; – the name of the map source,

&lt;url&gt; – the path for the tiles of the map source with the specific placeholders in curly brackets:

* {$z} – the zoom level,  
* {$x} – the X tile coordinate,  
* {$y} – the Y tile coordinate,  
* {$invX} – the inverted X tile coordinate,  
* {$invY} – the inverted Y tile coordinate,  
* {$serverpart} – \(optional\) in case of multiple servers for the map source.  
* &lt;serverParts&gt; – a space-separated list of parts that replace the {$serverpart} in &lt;url&gt; tag.  
* &lt;retina&gt; – tag for defining the size of Retina map tiles:

* &lt;retina&gt;1&lt;/retina&gt; – for 512х512 px \(e.g. Google Maps HD\),
* &lt;retina&gt;2&lt;/retina&gt; – for 256х256 px \(e.g. CloudMade HD\).

**How to add**. There are several ways to add custom online map source to the app:
1. Place the XML file in the app shared folder in iTunes.
2. Open the XML file attached in Email on your device using the "Open in Galileo" option.
3. Open the XML file from Dropbox on your device using the "Open in.." option.
	
As a result, the new map source will appear in Map Source list.

**Troubleshooting**. Sometimes you can see empty map areas (tiles), with the following warning messages on the map:
* "_Tile loading error_. Please check your Internet connection" – this appears when tiles are missing in the cache and app can't download them. Enable an Internet connection or go to ’online’ mode to load the missing tiles.
* "_Tile loading error_. Wrong response from the server" – the online server is not responding. Try to navigate to this area later to reload any missing tiles.

## Offline Maps Import ##

Feature, available as an in-app purchase, allows you to import previously created custom offline maps in .sqlitedb or .mbtiles format.
**Creating an offline map**. The main idea is to create an offline map for the desired area in advance with one of the following tools on your computer using one of the following tools:

* [Mobile Atlas Creator](http://mobac.sourceforge.net/) (known also as MOBAC)
* [TileMill](https://tilemill-project.github.io/tilemill/)
* [SAS.Planet](http://sasgis.ru/sasplaneta/)

_Mobile Atlas Creator (MOBAC)_ – is free software that allows you to download maps from numerous map sources, and save them in the .sqlitedb format used by Galileo Offline Maps. This tool is compatible with Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

Reference: to learn how to create offline maps in **.sqlitedb** format, please refer to the [MOBAC manual](http://mobac.sourceforge.net/quickstart/).
				
_TileMill (by MapBox)_ – is a desktop application for cartographers to quickly and easily design and create stunning offline maps in the .mbtiles format supported by Galileo Offline Maps. It is completely compatible with Mac OS X, Windows and Ubuntu.

Reference: to learn how to create offline maps in **.mbtiles** format, please refer to the [TileMill manual](https://tilemill-project.github.io/tilemill/docs/manual/).
					
SAS.Planet – is a program designed for viewing and downloading high-resolution satellite imagery and conventional maps in .sqlitedb format.

**Importing offline maps**. Once you have created an offline map, you should upload it to your device. There are two ways to import an offline map into your device: via iTunes or Dropbox.

**Using offline maps**. Go to Map Source in app settings and select the imported map name in the list and back to the map view. If you are not over the area with offline map, tap the green arrow indicating the direction to the offline map. Zoom in to see a detailed view of your offline map.
						
**Troubleshooting**. Sometimes you can see empty map areas, with the following warning messages on the map:
						
"_Tile is not in your offline map. Please add more layers._" – this means that there are no map tiles on the current zoom level in your offline map. You have probably imported insufficiently detailed levels, so when you zoom in there are no downloaded tiles for that level.

## MIUI users troubleshooting ##

**Xiaomi and other MIUI phones issue**. MIUI by default doesn’t let apps in the background access GPS, which is what causes this issue.

Here’s what you need to do to solve the problem:

* Pull down toggle bar.
* Hold the GPS icon to reach GPS settings.
* Here, change Location mode to High accuracy

To make sure the app isn’t killed while in background go to Settings  > Battery & performance > Manage app battery usage, now disable/turn off Power saving mode or add Galileo to battery saver exceptions, by clicking Choose apps > Galileo > No restrictions.
